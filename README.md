# JDBC-Crud-Project

## Overview
This Java JDBC project allows users to interact with a database, performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The project is structured into different modules, each responsible for specific database operations.

## Files
- `Main.java`: User interface for interaction.
- `InsertOperations.java`: Manages the insertion of data into the database.
- `UpdateOperations.java`: Handles updating existing data in the database.
- `DeleteOperations.java`: Manages the deletion of data from the database.
- `SelectOperations.java`: Handles data selection from the database.

## Setup and Usage
### Database Setup:
- Make sure you have a JDBC-compliant database installed (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- Modify the connection URL, username, and password in the code to match your database configuration.

### Execution:
- Compile and run `Main.java` to access the user interface.
- Follow the prompts to perform various database operations.

## Instructions
- **Insert Operation:**
  - Use the interface to add new records to the database.

- **Update Operation:**
  - Input the record ID and new data to update existing records in the database.

- **Delete Operation:**
  - Enter the record ID to delete it from the database.

- **Select Operation:**
  - Utilize the options provided to retrieve data from the database based on specific criteria.

## Additional Notes
- The project lacks extensive error handling and validation. Enhance the code to ensure robustness.
- Ensure the incorporation of database security practices and proper exception handling for a production environment.
